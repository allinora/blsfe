h1. jQuery Hint Plugin with support for password fields

This is a plugin for displaying a hint inside an input field, only when it is blurred and has no value.

There are many plugins like these out there, I picked Remy Sharp's [1] and added support for password fields,
using a strategy outlined by Roshan Bhattarai[2].
